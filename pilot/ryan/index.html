    What goals: Since I was a young boy I have always been amazed by planets and outerspace and the unknown. This amazement and wonder is what led me to be a pilot. To this day, I have been on 10 trips to various planets and I am greatly looking forward to this next trip to Mars.
    <br>
    What attitude: To make your journey pleasant, I will point out famous stars and other planets along the way.
    <br>
    Which behavior: Travis has been a pilot for us for many years and loves his job. Those are his words not ours! He gets a choice on what rocket to use so he is most comfortable with it and ensures its safety as well. He enjoys getting to know his customers and ensuring they have a great time!
